# Heart_Disease_Inequality_Analysis

**🧠 Project Overview:**

A comprehensive data analysis project exploring how lifestyle, diet, access to healthcare, and socioeconomic status intersect with heart disease risk across different population groups.  

|🔍 _"How does inequality impact heart disease risk in the U.S. population?"_


**🔍 Objective:**

- Identify how behavioral and socioeconomic variables impact heart disease risk.
  
- Examine how combinations of factors contribute to unequal health outcomes.
  
- Build compelling data visualizations that highlight key patterns and gaps in access to care.
- 

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies:**

\* R (tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, plotly)

\* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

\* Data Visualization (static + interactive heatmaps)

\* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**📈 Key Analyses Performed:**

\* Data Cleaning & Labeling: Recoded variables (e.g. income, education, BMI) for interpretability.

\* Descriptive EDA: Plotted categorical breakdowns for smoking, alcohol, physical activity, BMI, etc.

\* Lifestyle Heatmaps: Show how lifestyle combinations affect heart disease rates.

\* Diet vs BMI Heatmap: Combined effect of diet quality and body composition.

\* Access to Care: Evaluated how costs prevent care in at-risk groups.

\* Socioeconomic Heatmaps: Showed income/education links with health outcomes.

\* Intersectional Analysis: Combined high-risk lifestyle/diet groups with access barriers.


**📌 Insights & Takeaways:**

**🧠 Key Insight:** Individuals with poor lifestyle and diet habits are more likely to develop heart disease — yet many of these groups also face cost-related barriers to accessing care.

**📉 Inequality Highlight:** Low-income, low-education individuals with poor health habits are doubly disadvantaged — they are both more at risk and less likely to receive preventive care.

**🧰 Analyst Perspective:** The focus was not only on results but on how an analyst approaches problem-solving — from asking the right questions to cleaning, merging, and interpreting multidimensional data.

**💡 Future Work:**

- Add logistic regression for predictive modeling.
  
- Extend analysis to state-wise comparisons or urban vs rural.
  
- Include healthcare access scores and insurance data (if available).
